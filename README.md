# Recovery-Delivered

## Tech Stack
- **React** (with Hooks)
- **Vite** for bundling and development server
- **React-Bootstrap** (if used)
- Other dependencies as needed (e.g. `react-simple-maps`, etc.)

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **npm** installed

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zeeshan-1998/Recovery-Delivered.git
cd Recovery-Delivered
### 2. Install dependencies
npm install
### 3. Start the development server
npm run dev

This runs the Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173 by default (or whichever port is assigned).
Your console will show the local and network addresses once it starts.

### 4. Open the App
Navigate to http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
You should see the projectâ€™s main page.
